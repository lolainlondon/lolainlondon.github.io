 <section id="aboutMe"><span id="bio">I’m Laura. I have a background in service improvement and customer service within the further education and housing sectors.
<br>
 I'm currently working as a head of product for a web application for a housing association. We broadly follow scrum methodology using Azure DevOps to track our work. I've really enjoyed getting to know the technologies involved in delivering the features my users need, and find that as my knowledge has increased that I can make better choices and write better user stories.
 <br>
 I’ve also found myself becoming more invested in helping to solve the challenges than in setting them. So, looking to my future I’ve decided to learn to code. I’m currently following the Codecademy Full Stack developer programme to give myself a good grounding in a range of aspects of the development life cycle.</span>
